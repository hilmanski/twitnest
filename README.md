## Name
- twitnest

## About
Convert tweets into a blog in one click (just sign in -> then done!)


## To Do Later
- test new tweet, that continue to a certain thread (no function) for this yet. Idea: on fetch -> check db if no parent. collect all in array if no parent. attach later.
- (Later) Fetch old


## Info
We filter out:
- Retweet
- Reply to a tweet that not yours
- Tweet that starts with mention to other account


## Caveat:
currently we're fetching only last 100
