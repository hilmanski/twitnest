## Landing page
- Elegant and modern design
- clear feature
- make unncessary step (click for ex) becaome automatically
- list all benefits
- list bad if only tweet (not ur platform) // no control // no nice home // no ads // etc...


## Next step

- Add SEO in single page (title and snippet next/head)
- show setting page when 'owner -> turn owner as function '
- Pada saat login (harusnya langsung auto fetch data user. No need 'check timeline')
- Auto import show loading indicator
- Render Media (check video)
- Fetch new [done]

## Later
- test new tweet, that continue to a certain thread (no function)
        for this yet. Idea: on fetch -> check db if no parent
        collect all in array if no parent. attach later.
- Better protection instead of checking email
    -> idea: add more info to session
    -> most secure is load user first (check ownership) 
- (Later) Fetch old
