## Next step

- Landing page
    - clear feature
    - list all benefits
    - list bad if only rely on twitter (not ur platform) // no control // no nice home // no ads // etc...

- Add SEO in single page (title and snippet next/head)
- Render Media (check video)
- Fetch new [done]

## Later
- test new tweet, that continue to a certain thread (no function)
        for this yet. Idea: on fetch -> check db if no parent
        collect all in array if no parent. attach later.
- Better protection instead of checking email
    -> idea: add more info to session
    -> most secure is load user first (check ownership) 
- (Later) Fetch old
