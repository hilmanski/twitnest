Go to your profile is hard

Now:
Write article (schedule for tomorrow)
    It's okay to split some of them as standalone article at onebitedev


More better design
    remember UI/UX is important
    
Run linter
    see if anything you can improve

Refactor
    Can you refactor your prisma query in a function?

Make cool screenshot and better explanation
    on landing page.
    and clickable link | profile example |
    

## Next step

- Landing page
    - clear feature
    - list all benefits
    - list bad if only rely on twitter (not ur platform) // no control // no nice home // no ads // etc...

- Add SEO in single page (title and snippet next/head)
- Render Media (check video)
- Fetch new [done]

## Later
- test new tweet, that continue to a certain thread (no function)
        for this yet. Idea: on fetch -> check db if no parent
        collect all in array if no parent. attach later.
- (Later) Fetch old
